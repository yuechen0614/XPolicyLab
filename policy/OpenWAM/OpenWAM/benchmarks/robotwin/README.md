# RoboTwin Benchmark Evaluation

These scripts assume the OpenWAM policy server is **already running**. They only cover the RoboTwin side of the evaluation loop.

## README TODOs

- [x] Update per-task `limit_steps` based on observed episode lengths.
- [x] Confirm that `state` is correctly forwarded to the server: [`policy_config.yml`](policy_config.yml)'s `send_state` flag is active, and the default is `true` for proprio-conditioned checkpoints.
- [x] Add state-dimension fail-fast checks so RoboTwin eval errors immediately when `action_type` / `state_dim` do not match the checkpoint.
- [ ] Flesh out the debug-mode docs: spell out what gets saved, where, and under what names, so the user experience stays friendly.
- [ ] Investigate the timestamp-folder mismatch in RoboTwin's built-in `eval_results/` directory and see whether it can be fixed.
- [ ] Document `multi_eval.sh`'s `-n <name>` flag (what output path it produces); if `-n` is not strictly required, consider removing it.
- [ ] Clean up [`policy_config.yml`](policy_config.yml) — drop parameters that no longer have an effect.
- [x] Update [`README.md`](README.md): remove the per-task step-analysis section (and the scripts it references). Keep the resolved `limit_steps` numbers inline so users don't have to rerun the analysis.

## Files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `openwam2robotwin_interface.py` | RoboTwin client — talks to the WebSocket server. |
| `policy_config.yml` | Config template; `host` / `port` are injected at runtime. |

| `multi_eval.sh` | Run evaluation on multiple tasks sequentially. |
| `dispatcher.py` | Central **episode-level** scheduler (TCP): per-`(task,mode)` seed allocator + dynamic env-affinity/duplication + result aggregation. Has a `--self-test` fleet simulation and an optional live status HTTP endpoint. |
| `episode_worker.py` | One worker process = one `(task,mode)` assignment: boots the env once, then streams that task's episodes from the dispatcher. `--dry-run` simulates episodes with no RoboTwin. |
| `episode_eval.sh` | Env-setup shim (EGL/PYTHONPATH/CUDA) that execs one `episode_worker.py`. |
| `parallel_eval.sh` | Single-machine multi-GPU eval against already-running servers, using episode-level dynamic scheduling (dispatcher + one supervisor loop per GPU). |

## Episode-level dynamic scheduling

`parallel_eval.sh` and `dlc_parallel_eval.sh` schedule a **single episode** as
the unit of work, not a whole task. This eliminates the tail-idle waste of the
old whole-task queue: when there are more free GPUs than unstarted tasks, idle
GPUs join an in-progress task (spawn a duplicate env) to drain its remaining
episodes in parallel, so no GPU sits idle while any episode remains.

How it works:

- A central **dispatcher** (`dispatcher.py`; TCP, rank 0 in DLC) owns, per
  `(task, mode)`, a monotonic **seed allocator** and the episode counters. Every
  raw seed is handed out at most once globally, so no scene is ever evaluated
  twice (RoboTwin scenes are fully determined by their integer seed).
- Each GPU **slot** runs a supervisor loop that keeps launching
  `episode_worker.py`. A worker claims one `(task,mode)`, boots its RoboTwin env
  **once**, and streams that task's episodes: `request_seed` → expert-check →
  (valid) `request_commit` → policy rollout → `report_result`. The commit
  handshake makes each job land on **exactly `--test-num` episodes** (no
  overshoot). When the dispatcher drains the job, the worker exits and the
  supervisor launches a fresh one for the next assignment.
- **Duplication policy**: an idle slot first starts any unstarted task; when
  none remain it joins the in-progress task with the longest ETA, but **only if**
  that task still has at least `--min-remaining-for-dup` (θ) episodes left and is
  under its env cap (`ceil(remaining/θ)`). This avoids booting an env that the
  existing env(s) would finish before the new one is even ready.

New flags (both scripts):

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `--test-num` | `100` | Episodes per `(task,mode)`. |
| `--seed` | `0` | Base seed; `st_seed = 100000*(1+seed)`, matching RoboTwin. |
| `--min-remaining-for-dup` | `8` | θ: don't spawn a new env for a task with fewer remaining episodes. |
| `--no-dup` | off | Strict mode: exactly one env per task, never duplicate (most reproducible; equivalent to the old whole-task granularity per job). |
| `--dispatch-port` | `8790` | Dispatcher TCP port. |
| `--http-port` | `0` | Serve a live status page (`/` HTML, `/api/state` JSON); `0` = off. |

Liveness / watchdog (the dispatcher never hangs silently):

- **Stall abort** — if no worker sends any request for `--stall-timeout` seconds
  (default 1800), or zero workers are connected for `--idle-grace` seconds
  (default 120) while jobs remain, the dispatcher writes an `incomplete`
  `summary.tsv` and exits non-zero (2) instead of self-spinning forever (covers
  every slot retiring, or all workers going silent).
- **Hung-worker reclaim** — a worker emits a keep-alive heartbeat every ~50
  rollout steps, so a genuinely hung one (socket open but silent for
  `--worker-timeout` seconds, default 1200) has its in-flight seed returned and
  env slot freed for others. Thanks to the heartbeat this need only exceed ~50
  inference steps, not a whole episode. A late report from a revived worker is
  ignored (no double count).
- **Give-up cap** — a task whose expert-check almost never passes stops after
  `target × --max-attempt-factor` seed attempts (default 50; `0` = unlimited),
  is marked `exhausted` in `summary.tsv`, and the run still terminates (exit 3).
- On exit (complete / exhausted / stall) the dispatcher touches a shared
  `.done` file; each node's launcher reaps its local (even wedged) workers on
  that signal, so no node's `wait` hangs on a stuck sim process.

Determinism note: the first `test_num` valid episodes of each task use the same
scenes as an upstream single-process run (seeds are handed out in order and a
seed's validity is policy-independent); only the assignment of episodes to GPUs
is non-deterministic. Use `--no-dup` for the most reproducible, single-stream
behavior.

Outputs land in the log directory: `results.jsonl` (one line per completed
episode — the authoritative record), `summary.tsv` (per-`(task,mode)` success
rate), `state.json` (live snapshot, rewritten atomically as the run progresses),
and `run.env` (parameters). Turn them into a CSV with `export_results_csv.py`.

Live monitoring:

- **`web_control.py`** (recommended, especially for DLC) reads `state.json` /
  `results.jsonl` straight from the shared log directory — no network path to the
  compute nodes needed:
  `python benchmarks/web_control.py <log_dir> --benchmark robotwin --port 8765`.
- **`--http-port`** on the dispatcher serves the same live data directly, but is
  **off by default** and only useful when you can reach the dispatcher host
  (single-machine `parallel_eval.sh`); on DLC the rank-0 port is usually not
  routable, so prefer `web_control.py` on the shared FS.

### Dry-run (no GPUs / no RoboTwin)

Both the scheduling logic and the whole orchestration can be exercised without a
simulator:

```bash
# Fleet simulation: models env-boot cost + episode time, prints dup-vs-no-dup
# makespan/utilization and asserts exact counts + zero duplicate seeds.
python benchmarks/robotwin/dispatcher.py --self-test

# End-to-end orchestration smoke (dispatcher + supervisors + fake workers):
NNODES=1 NODE_RANK=0 ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID=smoke ROBOTWIN_LOG_ROOT=/tmp/rt \
DISPATCHER_ADVERTISE_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
bash benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_parallel_eval.sh --dry-run \
    -m demo_clean -n smoke -d /unused -w 4 --test-num 8 \
    adjust_bottle open_laptop lift_pot
```

## Per-task step_lim overrides

RoboTwin ships upstream per-task step limits in `task_config/_eval_step_limit.yml`. To tweak them without patching the RoboTwin source tree, edit [`step_limits.yml`](step_limits.yml) in this directory:

```yaml
# step_limits.yml (values here match what is checked in)
adjust_bottle: 160
open_laptop: 288
put_bottles_dustbin: 640
```

Semantics:

- Any task listed here overrides RoboTwin's upstream value for that task.
- Tasks not listed keep RoboTwin's original value (which itself falls back to `1000` when the upstream file also lacks the task).
- The file is loaded once at adapter import and applied at the first step of each episode via `TASK_ENV.step_lim = <override>`. Edits to the YAML only take effect in a fresh eval process — restart the evaluation after tweaking values.
- Leaving the file empty (comments only) reproduces stock RoboTwin behavior.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install the RoboTwin environment

Follow the [official RoboTwin installation guide](https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin) to clone the repo, create the Conda environment, install dependencies, and download assets. When you're done you should have a working RoboTwin Conda environment (default name `robotwin`) and a local checkout of the RoboTwin repository.

### 2. Set environment variables

```bash
export ROBOTWIN_PATH=/path/to/RoboTwin      # RoboTwin repo root (required)

export ROBOTWIN_ENV=robotwin                # RoboTwin Conda env name (default: robotwin)
```

### 3. Match the checkpoint action/state mode

`policy_config.yml` must match the checkpoint's saved `config.yaml`:

- `dataloader.action_mode: eef` / `architecture.state_dim: 20` → keep `action_type: ee`, `state_dim: 20`.
- `dataloader.action_mode: joint` / `architecture.state_dim: 14` → set `action_type: qpos`, `state_dim: 14`.
- Keep `send_state: true` for any checkpoint with `architecture.use_proprioception: true`; the adapter will fail fast if the extracted RoboTwin state dimension is wrong.

### 4. Start the OpenWAM server

Start the server separately before running any evaluation (it can live on a remote machine — just make sure the host/IP and the port are reachable):

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh --ckpt-dir /path/to/ckpt_dir --port XXXX
```

## Usage

### Single-task evaluation

**Invocation:**

```bash
bash single_eval.sh <task_name> <task_config> <ckpt_setting> <gpu_id> [port] [host]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `task_name` | RoboTwin task name (e.g. `adjust_bottle`). |
| `task_config` | `demo_clean` or `demo_randomized`. |
| `ckpt_setting` | Label written into result filenames (e.g. `openwam`). |
| `gpu_id` | CUDA device for the RoboTwin simulator. |
| `port` | OpenWAM server port (default: `8848`). |
| `host` | OpenWAM server address (default: `127.0.0.1`). |

**Example:**

```bash
bash single_eval.sh adjust_bottle demo_clean openwam 0 8848 127.0.0.1
```


### Multi-task evaluation

```bash
bash multi_eval.sh -m <mode> -n <name> -d <ckpt_dir> [options] <tasks...>
```

**Required flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-m`, `--mode` | `demo_clean` or `demo_randomized`. |
| `-n`, `--name` | Label used for the log directory. |
| `-d`, `--ckpt-dir` | OpenWAM checkpoint directory used for log placement and run labeling; the evaluator still talks to an already-running server and does not load weights. |

**Optional flags:**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--host` | `127.0.0.1` | OpenWAM server address. |
| `--port` | `8848` | OpenWAM server port. |
| `-g`, `--gpu` | `0` | CUDA device for the RoboTwin simulator. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run two named tasks
bash multi_eval.sh -m demo_clean -n run1 -d /path/to/ckpt_dir \
    adjust_bottle open_laptop

# Run all 50 RoboTwin 2.0 tasks
bash multi_eval.sh -m demo_randomized -n run1 -d /path/to/ckpt_dir all

# Point at a remote server
bash multi_eval.sh -m demo_clean -n run1 -d /path/to/ckpt_dir \
    --host 192.168.1.10 --port 8768 all

# Read the task list from a file (one task per line, `#` comments supported)
bash multi_eval.sh -m demo_clean -n run1 -d /path/to/ckpt_dir tasks.txt
```

### DLC multi-node parallel evaluation

> **Scheduling model updated.** `dlc_parallel_eval.sh` now uses the
> **episode-level dispatcher** described in "Episode-level dynamic scheduling"
> above: rank 0 runs a TCP dispatcher and publishes its address to
> `<log_dir>/.dispatcher_addr`; every node starts local servers + slot
> supervisors that claim *episodes* (not whole tasks) from it. The old
> `queue/pending` + atomic-`mv` per-`task|mode` claim protocol and node-done
> sentinels are **gone** — scheduling, seed dedup, and aggregation all live in
> the dispatcher. Some paragraphs below still describe the old file-queue layout
> for historical reference; the authoritative behavior and flags are in the
> section above. Results are in `results.jsonl` / `summary.tsv` / `state.json`.

`dlc_parallel_eval.sh` is the cluster entrypoint for large runs. Launch the same command on every DLC worker. Each node starts one OpenWAM server per local worker, waits for the server to accept connections, then starts RoboTwin slot supervisors that claim episodes from the rank-0 dispatcher.

This script does **not** require pre-starting OpenWAM servers with `scripts/deploy_multi.sh`; it starts and cleans up its own local servers on every node. It still requires a RoboTwin Python environment for the simulator/client process.

By default, each local policy server is launched as:

```bash
python <repo>/scripts/deploy.py ...
```

Override `SERVER_PYTHON` / `--server-python` or `SERVER_SCRIPT` / `--server-script` if the server must run under a specific Python executable or a custom deploy script. `SERVER_PYTHON` must be an OpenWAM-capable environment with packages such as `torch`, `omegaconf`, `safetensors`, and `websockets`; it is separate from `ROBOTWIN_PYTHON`, which runs the simulator/client side.

**Required environment:**

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ROBOTWIN_PATH` | RoboTwin repository root. Must be visible on every node. |
| `ROBOTWIN_PYTHON` | Python executable inside the RoboTwin environment. If unset, the script searches for `ROBOTWIN_ENV` as a conda env. |
| `ROBOTWIN_ENV` | Conda env name used only when `ROBOTWIN_PYTHON` is unset. Default: `robotwin`. |
| `SERVER_PYTHON` | Python executable for OpenWAM policy servers. Use the OpenWAM env unless the RoboTwin env also has the OpenWAM server dependencies. |

**DLC / multi-node environment:**

The script prefers DLC variables when present:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MLP_WORKER_NUM` | Total node count. |
| `MLP_ROLE_INDEX` | Current node rank. |

It falls back to `NNODES` / `NODE_RANK`, then `WORLD_SIZE` / `RANK`, so local smoke tests can be run manually.

**Invocation:**

```bash
ROBOTWIN_PATH=/mnt/cpfs/zch/RoboTwin \
ROBOTWIN_PYTHON=/mnt/cpfs/zch/envs/RoboTwin/bin/python \
SERVER_PYTHON=/mnt/cpfs/zch/wuji-openwam-dev/.venv/bin/python \
ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID=test \
bash benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_parallel_eval.sh \
    -m all -n openwam -d /mnt/cpfs/wangyuran/openwam_checkpoints/robotwin_dual_system_joint_self_attention \
    --denoise-steps 10 \
    all
```

**Required flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `-m`, `--mode` | `demo_clean`, `demo_randomized`, or `all`. `all` expands to both modes. |
| `-n`, `--name` | Run label used in log directory names and RoboTwin result naming. |
| `-d`, `--ckpt-dir` | OpenWAM checkpoint directory used by each local policy server. |

Tasks are positional after flags. They can be task names, comma-separated task names, `all`, or a task-list file with one task per line.

**Useful overrides:**

Scheduling / run (see also "Episode-level dynamic scheduling" above):

| Variable / flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID` | `latest` | Shared run id used in the log path; change it for reruns. |
| `ROBOTWIN_LOG_ROOT` | `<ckpt_dir>/robotwin_eval_logs` | Shared-filesystem root for the dispatcher address, `results.jsonl`, `summary.tsv`, `state.json`, and logs. |
| `-w`, `--num-workers` | GPU count | Local OpenWAM servers + RoboTwin slot supervisors per node. |
| `--gpu-start` | `0` | First local GPU index. |
| `SIM_GPU_STRIDE` | `1` | Stride between worker GPUs. |
| `PORT_BASE`, `--port` | `8848` | Per-node local policy-server port base; worker `i` uses base `+ i`. |
| `--test-num` | `100` | Episodes per `(task,mode)`. |
| `--seed` | `0` | Base seed (`st_seed = 100000*(1+seed)`). |
| `--min-remaining-for-dup` | `8` | θ: don't add a duplicate env to a task with fewer remaining episodes. |
| `--no-dup` | off | One env per task, never duplicate (most reproducible). |
| `--dispatch-port` | `8790` | Dispatcher TCP port (rank 0 binds `0.0.0.0`). |
| `--http-port` | `0` (off) | Dispatcher live-status HTTP port; prefer `web_control.py` on DLC. |
| `DISPATCHER_PYTHON` | `SERVER_PYTHON` | Python that runs the dispatcher (stdlib only). |
| `DISPATCHER_ADVERTISE_HOST` | `MASTER_ADDR` / `hostname -i` | Rank-0 host written to `.dispatcher_addr` for other nodes. |
| `STALL_TIMEOUT` env | `1800` | Abort (incomplete) after this many seconds with no dispatcher RPC. |
| `WORKER_TIMEOUT` env | `1200` | Reclaim a worker silent (no heartbeat) this long; need only exceed ~50 inference steps, not a whole episode. |
| `IDLE_GRACE` env | `120` | Abort if zero workers are connected this long while jobs remain. |
| `MAX_ATTEMPT_FACTOR` env | `50` | Give up on a task after `target × factor` seed attempts (`0` = unlimited). |

Server / deploy passthrough:

| Variable / flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVER_PYTHON`, `--server-python` | `python` | Python used to launch each local policy server; must have OpenWAM server deps. |
| `SERVER_SCRIPT`, `--server-script` | `<repo>/scripts/deploy.py` | Script used to launch each local policy server. |
| `--bind-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Host passed to `scripts/deploy.py --host`. |
| `--client-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Host RoboTwin clients use to reach their local server. |
| `--ckpt-name` | latest checkpoint | Specific checkpoint filename passed to `scripts/deploy.py`. |
| `--denoise-steps` | config default | Denoising step count passed to `scripts/deploy.py`. |
| `--denoise-mode` | config default | Denoising mode (`sync`/`async`). |
| `--lead-modality` | config default | Leading modality for async denoising. |
| `--variance-shift-alpha` | config default | Lead curve shift for async denoising. |
| `--linear-offset` | config default | Lag start delay for async denoising. |
| `--inference-mode` | config default | Inference mode (`sync`/`async`). |
| `--inference-horizon` | config default | Actions consumed per generated chunk in both sync and async modes. |
| `--inference-delay-steps` | config default | Async inference delay passed to `scripts/deploy.py`. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Skip servers/RoboTwin; run the dispatcher + simulated workers only. |
| `--fresh` | off | Remove this run id's stale `.dispatcher_addr` / `results.jsonl` / `summary.tsv` / `state.json` / `.done` / `run.env` before rank 0 starts. |

**Shared log directory:**

By default:

```text
<ckpt_dir>/robotwin_eval_logs/<name>_<mode>_dlc_<run_id>
```

If `ROBOTWIN_LOG_ROOT` is set:

```text
<ROBOTWIN_LOG_ROOT>/<name>_<mode>_dlc_<run_id>
```

This directory must be on a shared filesystem visible to every node: rank 0
publishes the dispatcher address to `.dispatcher_addr`, and all nodes read it,
write per-episode records to `results.jsonl`, and read the live `state.json`.
There is no shared file queue any more — scheduling and seed dedup live in the
dispatcher process (rank 0), so `queue/`, `.queue_ready`, `.queue.txt`, and the
`summary.lock.d/` summary lock are gone.

**Dry-run task assignment test:**

Use `--dry-run` to validate that a launch can coordinate all nodes and
distribute episodes before spending GPU time. Dry-run starts the rank-0
dispatcher and simulated workers (`episode_worker.py --dry-run`, no RoboTwin),
which sleep for each episode instead of running a simulator, then writes
`summary.tsv` and runs the rank-0 completeness check. It needs neither
`ROBOTWIN_PATH`/`ROBOTWIN_PYTHON`/`SERVER_PYTHON` nor a real checkpoint.

```bash
ROBOTWIN_LOG_ROOT=/shared/path/robotwin_eval_logs \
ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID=dryrun_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S) \
DISPATCHER_PYTHON=python3 \
bash benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_parallel_eval.sh \
    --dry-run \
    -m all -n dryrun -d /unused/ckpt_dir \
    -w 8 --test-num 20 \
    adjust_bottle open_laptop
```

`DRY_RUN_SLEEP_SEC` (default `0.5`) sets the simulated per-episode rollout time,
useful for watching the duplication/tail-fill behavior.

Important files:

```text
<log_dir>/
  run.env             # frozen parameters
  .dispatcher_addr    # rank-0 host:port the workers connect to
  results.jsonl       # one line per completed episode (authoritative)
  summary.tsv         # per-(task,mode): success / episodes / rate / status
  state.json          # live snapshot (progress, live_envs, remaining, ...)
  .done               # touched on exit -> every node reaps local workers
  dispatcher.log      # rank 0 only
  node0/
    servers/
      server_worker0_gpu0.log
    worker0/
      worker.log        # supervisor loop for this GPU slot
      run001.log        # one episode_worker process (one (task,mode) assignment)
      run002.log        # ...next assignment on this slot
  node1/
    ...
```

Useful commands:

```bash
# Rank-0 dispatcher log (scheduling decisions, stall/abort messages)
tail -f <log_dir>/dispatcher.log

# Server log for node0 worker0
tail -f <log_dir>/node0/servers/server_worker0_gpu0.log

# Supervisor loop for node0 slot 0
tail -f <log_dir>/node0/worker0/worker.log

# Latest episode_worker process on node0 slot 0
tail -f "$(ls -t <log_dir>/node0/worker0/run*.log | head -1)"

# Per-(task,mode) status table
column -t -s $'\t' < <log_dir>/summary.tsv
```

**Real-time web control console:**

Instead of tailing several files by hand, start the dependency-free benchmark
dashboard against the shared log directory:

```bash
python benchmarks/web_control.py <log_dir> \
    --benchmark robotwin \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8765
```

The legacy RoboTwin command, `python benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_web_console.py
<log_dir>`, remains available and forwards to the same implementation.

Open `http://<node-ip>:8765/` to watch queue progress, task status,
success-rate parsing, consistency checks, failed-task snippets,
node/worker/server logs, and a live tail pane. The dashboard also exposes
`/api/state`, `/api/tail?file=<relative-log-path>`, raw log links, and a CSV
download at `/api/results.csv`. Use `--host 127.0.0.1` for local-only access.

**Live vs. completed success rate:** RoboTwin re-prints a cumulative
`Success rate: X/Y` after every episode, so a running task's parsed `X/Y` is
its partial result so far. The `Success` and `Episodes` cards and the two
per-mode cards therefore report the **live** episode-weighted rate, pooling
every episode evaluated so far including those partials — hover any of them for
the breakdown. `/api/state` carries both flavours:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `rates.live_success_rate`, `live_success`, `live_total` | Episode-weighted over completed **and** running tasks. What the cards show. |
| `rates.running_success`, `running_total`, `running_task_count` | The in-progress contribution on its own. |
| `rates.weighted_success_rate`, `weighted_success`, `weighted_total` | Completed tasks only — the comparable end-of-run number. |
| `rates.mean_task_success_rate`, `parsed_task_count` | Unweighted mean of per-task rates, completed tasks only. |

Quote `weighted_success_rate` when reporting a finished run; `live_success_rate`
drifts while tasks are mid-flight and is only meaningful as a progress readout.

Useful console knobs:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `--tail-bytes` | `200000` | Initial bytes returned by the tail pane. |
| `--state-tail-bytes` | `256000` | Bytes scanned per task log for success-rate parsing. |
| `--max-logs` | `2000` | Maximum log-like files shown in the log browser. |
| `--max-task-log-bytes` | `4000000` | Bytes scanned per failed task for error snippets. |

**Single-node smoke example:**

```bash
ROBOTWIN_PATH=/path/to/RoboTwin \
ROBOTWIN_PYTHON=/path/to/conda/envs/robotwin/bin/python \
NNODES=1 NODE_RANK=0 ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID=smoke \
bash benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_parallel_eval.sh \
    -m demo_clean -n smoke -d /path/to/ckpt_dir \
    -w 1 \
    adjust_bottle
```

**Custom server Python/script example:**

```bash
ROBOTWIN_PATH=/path/to/RoboTwin \
ROBOTWIN_PYTHON=/path/to/conda/envs/robotwin/bin/python \
SERVER_PYTHON=/path/to/server/env/bin/python \
SERVER_SCRIPT=/path/to/custom_deploy.py \
NNODES=1 NODE_RANK=0 ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID=custom_server \
bash benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_parallel_eval.sh \
    -m demo_clean -n custom_server -d /path/to/ckpt_dir \
    -w 1 \
    adjust_bottle
```

### Export evaluation results to CSV

Use `export_results_csv.py` after a run to produce a single CSV. For
episode-level runs it aggregates the authoritative per-episode `results.jsonl`
(success / episodes / step-limit hits per `(task,mode)`); if that file is absent
(legacy whole-task runs) it falls back to `summary.tsv` plus per-task
`Success rate` log grepping.

**Invocation:**

```bash
python benchmarks/robotwin/export_results_csv.py \
    /path/to/log_dir \
    -o /path/to/log_dir/results.csv
```

If `-o` is omitted, the default output is:

```text
<log_dir>/results.csv
```

The CSV columns are:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `run_id` | `ROBOTWIN_RUN_ID` recorded by `dlc_parallel_eval.sh`. |
| `policy_name` | Value passed with `-n`, `--name`. |
| `requested_mode` | Original `-m`, `--mode` value. |
| `task` | RoboTwin task name. |
| `mode` | Concrete task config: `demo_clean` or `demo_randomized`. |
| `node` | Node rank (blank for episode-level runs — a task's episodes span nodes/workers). |
| `worker` | Local worker index (blank for episode-level runs, same reason). |
| `status` | `ok` (target reached), `exhausted` (gave up per max-attempts), or `incomplete`. Legacy runs: `ok`/`failed`. |
| `exit_code` | Task process exit code (blank for episode-level runs). |
| `success_rate` | Success rate. Episode-level: `successes/episodes` from `results.jsonl` (percent). Legacy: parsed from the task log. |
| `episodes` | Completed episodes for the `(task,mode)`. Episode-level: count in `results.jsonl`. Legacy: `Success!`/`Fail!` verdicts in the log. |
| `step_limit_hits` | Episodes truncated at `step_lim` (ran out of steps rather than reaching a terminal state) — **not necessarily model errors**; a high count means `step_lim` may be too tight (see `step_limits.yml`). |
| `log_path` | `results.jsonl` for episode-level runs; the per-task log for legacy runs. |

The exporter also validates completeness when `run.env` is available: episode-level runs flag any `(task,mode)` that reached fewer than `test_num` episodes; legacy runs report duplicate/missing/unexpected rows.

Strict parsing mode returns a non-zero exit code if any task log is missing, does not contain a parseable success rate, or fails the completeness checks above:

```bash
python benchmarks/robotwin/export_results_csv.py /path/to/log_dir --strict
```

## FAQ

### Render Error (headless servers)

On a headless Linux box the SAPIEN renderer fails to find an X display and raises `Render Error`. Start a virtual framebuffer (Xvfb):

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y xvfb   # if not installed yet
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 &
export DISPLAY=:99
bash single_eval.sh adjust_bottle demo_clean openwam 0 8848 127.0.0.1
```

Or, in one step, use `xvfb-run`:

```bash
xvfb-run -a bash single_eval.sh adjust_bottle demo_clean openwam 0 8848 127.0.0.1
```

### `policy_config.yml` options

```yaml
# Observation settings
# The client always forwards RoboTwin's head / left / right cameras to the server.
# The server inspects the checkpoint's saved config.yaml to decide:
#   - multiview=false → single-view preprocessing using head_camera only
#   - multiview=true  → composed into the L-shape multi-view layout used at training time
# The client no longer needs to configure camera selection or resolution.
send_state: true          # Include the proprio state vector in the obs message.
state_dim: 20             # Fail-fast expected dim. 20 for eef/ee, 14 for joint/qpos.
request_timeout: 300      # WebSocket timeout in seconds.

# Action settings (must match the `action_mode` used at training time).
action_type: ee           # ee   — EEF mode (action_mode: eef at train time, default).
                          #        Server returns 20D (xyz + rot6d + grip) × 2,
                          #        auto-converted to 16D (xyz + quat + grip) × 2 before dispatch.
                          # qpos — Joint-angle mode (action_mode: joint at train time).
                          #        Server returns 14D, passed straight to take_action.

# action_indices: null    # Optional index reordering for the returned action vector (null = no reorder).
```
