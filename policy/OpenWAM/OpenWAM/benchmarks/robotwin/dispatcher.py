"""Central episode-level dispatcher for parallel RoboTwin evaluation.

Why this exists
---------------
The old ``parallel_eval.sh`` / ``dlc_parallel_eval.sh`` scheduled a whole
``task|mode`` (all ``test_num`` episodes) as one indivisible queue item, so at
the tail of a run — when fewer live jobs remain than GPUs — most GPUs sat idle
waiting for the last few whole-task jobs to grind through 100 episodes each.

This dispatcher makes the schedulable unit a **single episode** while still
amortizing the expensive per-process environment boot: one worker process lives
for exactly one ``(task, mode)`` assignment and pulls many episodes for it, and
idle GPUs at the tail are allowed to *join* an already-running job (spawn a
duplicate env) to drain its remaining episodes in parallel.

Two layers live here:

* ``Scheduler`` — a pure, lock-guarded in-memory state machine implementing the
  scheduling policy and the seed/commit accounting. It has no networking and is
  what the unit tests and the ``--self-test`` simulation drive directly.
* ``Dispatcher`` — a thin newline-delimited-JSON TCP server wrapping a
  ``Scheduler``, one persistent connection per worker process.

RoboTwin episode facts this relies on (see script/eval_policy.py):

* A scene is fully determined by its integer ``seed``; whether a seed is
  "valid" (the scripted expert can solve it) depends only on ``(seed, task)``,
  not on the policy under test. So a single monotonic per-job seed allocator
  gives global dedup: every raw seed is tried at most once.
* The cheap expert-check happens *before* the expensive policy rollout, giving a
  natural commit point. The commit handshake below uses it to hit exactly
  ``test_num`` episodes with zero overshoot.

Protocol (one request line -> one response line, JSON objects):

    -> {"type":"hello","node":N,"worker":W,"gpu":G,"port":P}      <- {"ok":true}
    -> {"type":"request_task"}                                    <- {"action":"run","task":T,"mode":M} | {"action":"exit"}
    -> {"type":"request_seed"}                                    <- {"seed":N} | {"drain":true}
    -> {"type":"report_probe","seed":N,"valid":false}            <- {"ok":true}
    -> {"type":"request_commit","seed":N}                        <- {"commit":true} | {"commit":false}
    -> {"type":"report_result","seed":N,"success":B,"step_limit_hit":B}  <- {"ok":true}

A worker's job binding is scoped to its connection: ``request_task`` assigns one
job, and the connection is expected to close after a ``drain`` / ``commit:false``
(the supervisor then launches a fresh worker process that connects anew). If a
connection drops mid-episode, ``Scheduler.release`` returns the in-flight seed so
another worker picks up a replacement — no seed is ever double-counted.
