# OpenWAM Client Integration Guide

For users wiring their own robot or benchmark to an OpenWAM policy server.

Benchmark readiness notes, public baseline scores, and RoboCasa GR1 EEF data
preparation guidance are tracked in
[`BENCHMARK_STATS.md`](BENCHMARK_STATS.md).

**You don't need to know anything about the server** — its model, preprocessing,
multi-view composition, or checkpoint. Just speak the WebSocket
protocol below. Minimal client dependencies: `numpy`, `Pillow`, `websockets`
(plus `opencv-python` if you decode camera frames yourself). The wire contract
(message types) is mirrored on both sides: server constants in [`openwam/deploy/server.py`](../openwam/deploy/server.py), client constants in [`benchmarks/utils/transport.py`](utils/transport.py).

Bundled clients:

- [RoboTwin](robotwin/README.md)
- [LIBERO / LIBERO-plus](libero/README.md)
- [RoboCasa GR1](robocasa_gr1/README.md)
- [VLABench](vlabench/README.md)
- [RoboDojo](robodojo/README.md)

## 1. What the client sends

One call per control step: up to three lossless PNG camera frames + the task `prompt` — the exact string the model should see (the server forwards it verbatim; wrap it in your checkpoint's template first). Proprioceptive checkpoints also require a raw `state` vector whose length matches the checkpoint's `model.architecture.state_dim`.

```json
// obs message (Client → Server)
{
  "type": "obs",
  "images": {
    "head_camera":        "<base64 PNG>",       // required
    "left_wrist_camera":  "<base64 PNG>|null",  // optional
    "right_wrist_camera": "<base64 PNG>|null"   // optional
  },
  "prompt": "pick up the red bottle",          // sent verbatim; wrap per your checkpoint's template
  "state":  [float, ...]                       // required when use_proprioception=true
}
```

> **Prompt formatting.** The server forwards `prompt` to the model **verbatim** — it does *not* wrap or reformat it. Send the exact string the model was trained on. Each benchmark owns its prompt template; for RoboTwin checkpoints, wrap the raw instruction with [`benchmarks/robotwin/prompt_template.py`](robotwin/prompt_template.py) (the RoboTwin eval adapter does this for you).

Response (action message, Server → Client):

```json
{"type": "action", "action": [float × 20 or 14], "step": int, "latency_ms": float}
```

## 2. Three things you don't need to handle

- **Image sizing / aspect ratio.** Use the bundled benchmark adapter. RoboCasa365,
  LIBERO, BEHAVIOR, EBench, VLABench, and RoboCasa-GR1 reproduce their unchanged
  training readers' LANCZOS tile resize before sending; RoboTwin sends native
  camera sizes because its reader performs BILINEAR composition directly.
- **Action units.** For normalized checkpoints, the returned action is already denormalized to **physical units** (eef: xyz in meters, rot6d unitless, gripper 0-1; joint: radians). Feed it directly to your controller — do not multiply by any mean/std. If the checkpoint was trained with normalization disabled, deploy leaves actions and state in that raw training scale.
- **Execution mode / chunking.** Whether the server runs the sync executor (buffer-and-replan) or the async one (background prefetch, `inference.inference_mode: async`) is invisible on the wire: the protocol is always one obs in, one action out.

## 3. Camera field rules

- `head_camera`: **required**. Used as TI2V first-frame condition / single-view main view.
- `left_wrist_camera`, `right_wrist_camera`: optional. If missing or `null`:
  - Server is single-view → the field is ignored.
  - Server is multi-view → the slot is filled with a black frame. The model still runs, but accuracy degrades since you're out of the training distribution for wrist-conditioned checkpoints.
- `state`: required when the checkpoint has `model.architecture.use_proprioception: true`. The server validates the dimension before inference and returns a `ServerError` (status 400) for missing or mismatched state instead of failing later inside the model.

## 4. Episode lifecycle and reset

Within one episode, just keep calling `client.predict(payload)`. The server caches an action chunk internally: the first call runs full inference (~seconds), the next N-1 are buffer pops (<10 ms). It re-infers automatically when the buffer empties.

**You must call `client.reset()` between episodes.** The server keeps per-episode executor state that leaks across episode boundaries otherwise:

- the action chunk buffer — pending actions from the last inference
- the step counter (and, in async mode, any in-flight background inference)

Reset drops all of this and returns `{"type": "reset_ack"}`. It does **not** touch model weights or server-level config, so it's cheap (<1 ms) and safe to call defensively at the start of every episode.

When to call it:
- At the **start** of each new task / episode / rollout — including the very first one.
- After any hard failure (client timeout, controller fault) where you're not sure the action buffer is still valid.
- **Not** during normal step-to-step control. Calling `reset()` mid-episode forces the next `predict()` to pay full inference latency and discards the remaining action chunk.

Message shape:
```
reset message  → {"type": "reset"}

reset_ack      → {"type": "reset_ack"}
```

## 5. Using `benchmarks.utils`

Client helpers live under `benchmarks/utils/client.py` and can be imported directly:

```python
from benchmarks.utils import (
    build_payload,      # assemble the {"images": {...}, "prompt": ...} dict
    encode_path_b64,    # PNG path -> base64 str
    WSPolicyClient,     # WebSocket transport — predict() / reset() / ping()
    ServerError,        # structured server error: .status / .code / .message
)

ws_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:8848"

# One persistent connection; obs/reset auto-reconnect once on a dropped socket,
# ping fails fast. open_timeout caps connection setup; timeout caps a round-trip.
with WSPolicyClient(ws_url, timeout=300.0, open_timeout=10.0) as client:
    client.ping()        # verify / wait for the server to be up (raises if unreachable)

    # --- start of episode ---
    client.reset()

    # --- per-step ---
    head_b64  = encode_path_b64("/path/to/head.png")
    left_b64  = encode_path_b64("/path/to/left.png")   # or None
    right_b64 = encode_path_b64("/path/to/right.png")  # or None
    current_state = [0.0] * 20                         # replace with your raw proprio vector

    payload = build_payload(
        head=head_b64,
        left_wrist=left_b64,
        right_wrist=right_b64,
        prompt="pick up the red bottle",  # sent verbatim; wrap per your checkpoint's template first
        state=current_state,  # optional raw proprio; required for proprio-conditioned checkpoints
    )
    try:
        action = client.predict(payload)["action"]   # already in physical units — feed to controller
    except ServerError as e:
        print(f"server rejected the request [{e.status} {e.code}]: {e.message}")
        raise
```

The bundled test script ([scripts/inference_single_test.py](../scripts/inference_single_test.py)) imports from here, so it doubles as a reference integration. For a full real-robot adapter, see [benchmarks/robotwin/openwam2robotwin_interface.py](robotwin/openwam2robotwin_interface.py).

## 6. Error cheatsheet

| ServerError (status 400) message contains | Cause |
|---|---|
| `head_camera is required` | Missing or `null` head_camera |
| `client must send 'images' dict` | Legacy single-field `image` payload (no longer supported) |
| `failed to decode base64 image` | Corrupted base64 or invalid image bytes |
| `requires obs['state']` | Checkpoint uses proprioception but the payload omitted `state` |
| `state dimension mismatch` | Payload `state` length differs from checkpoint `state_dim` |
| `camera_layout` | Server config has fewer than 3 entries in `camera_layout` while multi-view is enabled — check the checkpoint |

## 8. Web control dashboard

Use `benchmarks/web_control.py` to inspect benchmark log directories from a
browser without installing frontend dependencies. The dashboard is a single
stdlib-only Python server with embedded HTML/CSS/JS.

```bash
python benchmarks/web_control.py <log_dir> \
    --benchmark auto \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8765
```

Open `http://<node-ip>:8765/` to view run progress, task/job state, parsed
metrics, failure snippets, log files, and a live tail pane. Use
`--host 127.0.0.1` when the dashboard should only be reachable locally.

Adapter choices:

| Adapter | Use case |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Default. Detects RoboTwin layouts from `run.env`, `summary.tsv`, `queue/`, or `node*/worker*`; otherwise uses generic log browsing. |
| `robotwin` | RoboTwin DLC/local evaluation logs with queue progress, success-rate parsing, node/worker/server logs, consistency checks, and CSV export. |
| `generic` | Any directory containing `*.log`, `*.out`, `*.err`, `stdout*`, or `stderr*` files. |

Useful options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `--tail-bytes` | `200000` | Bytes returned for the first tail request. |
| `--state-tail-bytes` | `256000` | Bytes scanned per task log for success-rate parsing. |
| `--max-logs` | `2000` | Maximum log-like files shown in the log browser. |
| `--max-task-log-bytes` | `4000000` | Bytes scanned per failed task for error snippets. |
| `--max-error-snippets` | `200` | Maximum failed-task snippets retained in `/api/state`. |
| `--refresh-sec` | `2.0` | Browser polling interval. |
| `--open` | off | Open a local browser after startup. |

HTTP endpoints:

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `/` | Dashboard page. |
| `/api/state` | Unified JSON state for benchmark metadata, progress, metrics, jobs, nodes, logs, failures, and validation issues. |
| `/api/tail?file=<relative-path>&offset=<n>&max_bytes=<n>` | Safe incremental log tail. Paths are restricted to `<log_dir>`. |
| `/raw?file=<relative-path>` | Raw text view for one log file. |
| `/api/results.csv` | Adapter-provided CSV export. |

For RoboTwin, this compatibility command is equivalent to passing
`--benchmark robotwin`:

```bash
python benchmarks/robotwin/dlc_web_console.py <log_dir> \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port 8765
```
