# Benchmark Statistics

This note keeps only high-level benchmark facts: dataset scale, public training
cost references, planning GPU-hour estimates, and reported baseline scores.

## Dataset Scale

### RoboCasa GR1

| Dataset / split | Tasks | Trajectories | Storage | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| NVIDIA `PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-Teleop-Sim` HDF5 | 24 | 24,000 | ~14 GB | 1,000 teleoperation trajectories per task. |
| NVIDIA `PhysicalAI-Robotics-GR00T-Teleop-Sim` LeRobot | 24 | 24,000 | ~39 GB | LeRobot-style release of the same simulation data. |
| DIAL full robot-only setting | 24 | 24,000 | same as above | Uses all 1,000 trajectories per task. |
| DIAL few-shot robot-only setting | 24 | 2,400 | subset | 100 trajectories per task. |
| DIAL human+robot setting | 24 GR1 tasks + EgoDex | 2,400 GR1 + EgoDex | mixed | Uses few-shot GR1 plus EgoDex basic-pick-place human demonstrations. |
| Online eval, DIAL in-distribution | 24 | 1,200 episodes | generated | 50 episodes per task. |

RoboCasa GR1 action/state conventions reported by DIAL:

- 29D joint-space GR1 control: dual arms 14D, hands 12D, waist 3D.
- 18D EEF pose: left wrist `(xyz3 + rot6d6)` and right wrist `(xyz3 + rot6d6)`.
- 47D combined simulation state/action reference: 29D joints + 18D EEF.

### VLABench

Official standard finetune release
([`VLABench/vlabench_primitive_ft_lerobot_video`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/VLABench/vlabench_primitive_ft_lerobot_video)),
10 primitive tasks x 500 episodes. Note `vlabench_primitive_ft_dataset` redirects to
`VLABench/raw_primitive_datasets` — the pre-conversion tarballs, not this LeRobot v3 release:

| Split | Tasks | Episodes | Frames | Storage | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `vlabench_primitive_ft_lerobot_video` | 10 (128 instruction variants) | 5,000 | 575,101 | ~13 GB | LeRobot v3, Franka Panda, 10 fps, 480x480 AV1 video per camera. |

Conventions:

- Three cameras: `image` (forward), `wrist_image`, `second_image` (the "right"
  external view).
- 7D state and action `[x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, gripper]`, absolute EE pose
  in the **robot base** frame; the reader converts to 10D EEF
  `[xyz3, rot6d6, grip1]` and scatters into unified slots 0-9.
- The two gripper columns carry **opposite** polarity (state 1 = closed,
  action 1 = open) because of an upstream Franka `get_ee_open_state` bug. Both
  are passed through verbatim so training and rollout agree. See
  [`openwam/dataloader/vlabench.py`](../openwam/dataloader/vlabench.py).

Evaluation is closed-loop in simulation over five fixed episode tracks; budget
30-60 minutes per task per process (VLABench renders every camera's RGB, depth
and segmentation each step, plus per-step IK).

**Upstream data defect.** The LeRobot conversion's `meta/episodes` is corrupt on
the Hub (not a damaged download): it writes
`dataset_from_index = length * episode_index`, as if every episode were the
length of the current one, and mis-assigns `data/chunk_index` /
`data/file_index` in step with it — 3,952 of 5,000 episodes point at the wrong
parquet shard. A loader that trusts those columns pairs each video clip with a
*different* episode's actions and prompt, which trains on systematically
mismatched supervision. `length` itself is sound (it sums to `total_frames` and
matches each episode's video frame count), the episodes are packed into shards
contiguously in `episode_index` order, and the video metadata is correct
(one mp4 per episode), so the true layout is exactly recoverable —
`VLABenchDataset._add_data_offsets` rebuilds it from real parquet row counts.
Worth keeping in mind when comparing against published numbers trained on this
same conversion.

## Training Cost References

GPU-hour values below are planning estimates unless the source publishes wall
time. Use `GPU-hours = number_of_GPUs * wall_clock_hours` once measured on the
target cluster.

| Benchmark / source | Hardware | Steps | Data scale | Estimated GPU-hours | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| OpenWAM debug config | any viable GPU node | 20 max steps | tiny smoke | <1 | Plumbing only, not a performance run. |
| RoboCasa GR1, NVIDIA GR00T N1.7 finetune | 8 GPUs | 60,000 | 24 tasks | ~500-1,300 | Official example uses `NUM_GPUS=8`, `GLOBAL_BATCH_SIZE=512`, `MAX_STEPS=60000`, `SAVE_STEPS=2000`; wall time not public. |
| RoboCasa GR1, DIAL full robot-only | not public | 160,000 | 24,000 trajectories | ~1,300-3,500 | 80K decoupled warmup + 80K end-to-end. |
| RoboCasa GR1, DIAL few-shot robot-only | not public | 40,000 | 2,400 trajectories | ~300-900 | 100 trajectories per task. |
| RoboCasa GR1, DIAL human+robot | not public | 60,000 | EgoDex + 2,400 GR1 | ~500-1,300 | 40K co-training + 20K GR1 finetune. |
| LIBERO, OpenVLA LoRA | 8x A100 80GB | 50K / 50K / 60K / 80K | 10 tasks per suite | ~400-1,400 per suite | Spatial/Object/Goal/Long respectively, batch size 128, LoRA rank 32. |

### VLABench

Track 1 (in-distribution) success rates published in the VLABench README
(2025/11/10). The maintainers' own summary of this table is
"Action representation matters" — the two Pi-fast rows differ only in action
representation and are 22 points apart.

| Method / checkpoint | Track 1 success | Details |
|---|---:|---|
| `pi0-fast-ft-primitive-10task-deltachunk` | 51.2% | Delta chunk, described upstream as the "aligned transform". |
| `pi0-primitive-10task` | 47.0% | Pi0 finetuned on the 10 primitive tasks. |
| `pi05-primitive-10task` | 40.6% | Pi0.5 finetuned on the 10 primitive tasks. |
| `pi0-fast-primitive-10task` | 29.1% | Relative chunk, the "official transform". |
