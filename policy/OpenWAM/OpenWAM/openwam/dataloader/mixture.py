"""MixtureDataset for multi-dataset co-training.

Combines multiple BaseDataset instances with configurable sampling weights,
enabling cross-dataset training. The shipped configuration currently composes
WorldEngine, AgiBotWorld, RoboCOIN, OXE-DROID, and InternData-A1.

Weight mechanism
----------------
Each sub-dataset is assigned a normalized weight w_i (sum = 1). The index
map is built once at __init__ by giving every sub-dataset a *virtual*
sample count:

    total_real  = sum of all sub-dataset real lengths
    virtual_n_i = round(total_real * w_norm_i)

Samples are drawn by cycling through the real dataset with ``vi % ds_len``.
``cycles_i = virtual_n_i / N_i``:
- cycles > 1 → oversampled (repeated visits)
- cycles < 1 → only a prefix of the source is visited at all per virtual
               epoch; the rest are NEVER seen unless ``set_epoch`` is
               called to re-shuffle.

Weight design strategies (see ``MixtureDataset.from_config`` for the
authoritative spec):

1. ``manual``: each sub-entry specifies its own ``weight`` field.
2. ``uniform``: every enabled source contributes equal virtual samples;
   small sources are oversampled, large ones undersampled.
3. ``inverse_size``: w_i ∝ 1 / (N_i × num_frames_i). Favors small sources.
4. ``proportional`` (default): w_i ∝ N_i. Every real sample visited
   exactly once per virtual epoch — no oversampling, no waste.

Per-epoch reshuffle
-------------------
The index_map is built ONCE at __init__. With non-proportional strategies,
some real samples may NEVER appear in any virtual epoch (those whose
source has cycles < 1, so virtual_n < N). Call ``mixture.set_epoch(epoch)``
at each epoch boundary to re-shuffle with seed=base_seed+epoch*7919, which
gives different sub-samples per epoch. With ``proportional`` this is
mostly cosmetic (full coverage every epoch regardless).

Per-source normalization
------------------------
MixtureDataset does NOT aggregate or apply any normalization. ``normalization_stats``
is hard-coded None. Each sub-source's reader handles its own normalization
in ``__getitem__`` (e.g. RoboCOINDataset applies per-bucket min-max with
its robot_type stats), so no downstream re-normalization happens.

Adjust weights at launch without editing the yaml:
    dataloader.datasets.robocoin.weight=3.0 dataloader.datasets.oxe_droid.weight=0.3

    defaults:
      - robocoin@datasets.robocoin
      - oxe_droid@datasets.oxe_droid
      - _self_

    type: mixture
    weight_strategy: proportional
    datasets:
      robocoin: {enabled: true, weight: 1.0}

    Samples are drawn from sub-datasets according to normalized weights.

        seed:                 Random seed for reproducible index shuffling.

        Repeated calls for the same epoch are no-ops.  Accelerate's
        ``DataLoaderShard.set_epoch`` forwards to datasets that implement this
        method, while the trainer also calls the underlying dataset directly;
        without the idempotence guard that pair would rebuild the production
        517M-row index map twice at every epoch boundary.  The map built by the
        constructor already represents epoch 0, so its first ``set_epoch(0)``
        is also intentionally free.

        ===================================================================
        ⚠️  CALLER REQUIREMENT — READ BEFORE USE  ⚠️

        This method mutates ``self._index_map`` in place. Under
        ``torch.utils.data.DataLoader`` with ``num_workers > 0``, each
        worker holds a forked copy of the dataset object; calling
        ``set_epoch`` on the parent only updates the parent's copy. To make
        the new shuffle visible inside the workers, the caller MUST:

          1. Use ``persistent_workers=False`` (workers are re-forked every
             epoch, so they pick up the parent's updated state on each
             epoch boundary), AND
          2. Call ``set_epoch(epoch)`` BEFORE constructing / iterating the
             DataLoader for that epoch (typically at the top of the
             per-epoch loop in the trainer).

        With ``persistent_workers=True`` the workers never see the new
        index_map — set_epoch becomes a silent no-op for sampling, and
        every epoch reuses the init-time shuffle. Use a custom Sampler
        instead if persistent workers are required.
        ===================================================================

        Mirrors ``torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler.set_epoch``:
        without this call the index_map keeps its init-time shuffle for the
        entire run — fine under ``proportional`` (full coverage every epoch
        regardless) but ``inverse_size`` / ``manual`` strategies will
        systematically miss any samples whose virtual_n < N.

        Safe to skip; default behavior is identical to the previous releases.
